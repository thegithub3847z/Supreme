Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) is a set of standardized characters used to create HTML
documents and was created to replace existing character sets to make a universal character set across all
platforms. HTML5 supports both UTF-8 and UTF-16. UTF-8 is the accepted character set for encoding e-mail and all webpages 
while UTF-16 is used for major operating systems and environments like Windows and Java. </p>

<h3>Leading (pronounced ledding) is a term that refers to controlling the vertical spacing between lines of text.  You can 
control the leading of text by using the LINE-HEIGHT property.  The value you assign is typically expressed as a multiple 
of the height of  the font.  However, you can also  assign spacing as a percentage of the font, or an absolute value measured 
in the form of point (pt), pixels (px), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), inches (in, picas (pc), x - height (ex), or em. </h3>
